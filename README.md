# Week One Challenge

## Description
The weekone challenge required me to edit and clean code for a website. This involved altering CSS and HTML code. I changed DIV semantics to better describe what the code within contained. The CSS code grouped classes that did the same thing into groups and when possible changed the groups into a singular new class or ID.
